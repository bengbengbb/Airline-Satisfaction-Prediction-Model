# Airline-Satisfaction-Prediction-Model

This is a class project in collaboration with Xinyu Hu, Francesca Caruso, Jiaqi Lu and Susannah Schulze.

Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/teejmahal20/airline-passenger-satisfaction

In this project we used three methods: Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest to classfy the passengers into satisfied and unsatisfied.

We found that the factors that have the most influence on customer satisfaction are Online Boarding, Inflight Wifi Service, Seat Comfort, Inflight Entertainment, and Ease of Online Booking.

Based on the results, we suggest improving the online booking and boarding system to help ourcustomers manage their flights and check in with ease. We also recommend providing better inflight wifi service and include the costs in the flight tickets. Finally, we propose targeting personal customers in the short-term while focusing on business travelers in the long-term concerning the different recovery phases after the pandemic.
